Then you can draw on the box below.

After filling in your personal information (including your student ID and Assignment score)  you can click the upload button to submit your signature. Note that your name, student ID and score should be the correct (these secret information is used for authentication). And the label is optional (for example, if you have different vertions a signatures, you may need the labels to distinguish).

Click the upload button, you can see the number on the badge increase one. Then you can safely clear the canvas and draw another new one. All saved signature in one session can be downloaded as a zip. The zip file will also include the sequences of $(x,y)$ coordinates of your signatures (if you want to experiment on the time dependency aspect)

To submit forged signatures:

You switch to the `forged` tab, and input the target name (using auto-completion again). Then click the download button (next to the upload button). If your target already upload the genuine signature, it will be displayed below for you to imitate.

After drawing the forged signature, click the upload button to submit. Note that the number on the badge won't change, and you will not be able to download these signature; instead,  you can ask friends to pick you as target and later on we will give you these forged signatures for training.
